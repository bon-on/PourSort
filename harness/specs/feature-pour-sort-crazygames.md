# Feature: PourSort CrazyGames web distribution

## Problem
The web build only runs on GitHub Pages. To upload it to CrazyGames the game
needs the HTML5 SDK v3 gameplay events, a relative-path bundle and no
outbound links or ads.

## Scope
- Only a web build made with `--dart-define=CRAZYGAMES=true` talks to the
  CrazyGames SDK. The GitHub Pages build (`--base-href /PourSort/`) and the mobile
  builds keep a no-op platform and behave exactly as before.
- `GamePlatform` interface (`initialize`, `gameplayStart`, `gameplayStop`), a
  no-op default and a `dart:js_interop` CrazyGames adapter.
- `SDK.init()` with a timeout; the SDK is used only when `environment` is
  `crazygames` or `local`. Missing SDK, rejected or hung init, or a throwing
  call downgrade to no-op.
- Gameplay events, sent on transitions only (never duplicated):
  - `gameplayStart` when the player is actually playing: the tutorial flag has
    been read, the how-to-play overlay is closed and the level is not cleared.
  - `gameplayStop` when the how-to-play overlay opens (first launch or the
    "?" button) and when the level is cleared.
  - `gameplayStart` again when the overlay closes, and when the next
    level starts after a clear.
  - On first launch the start is sent only after the tutorial is closed.
  
- No ads (Basic Launch forbids them; this game never had any) and no
  leaderboard or external result upload exist in this game, so nothing else is
  disabled in the CrazyGames build. There is no hub navigation bar to remove.
- `web/index.html` gets `user-select: none` and touch rules so text is not
  selected while playing (also applies to GitHub Pages).
- `tool/build_crazygames.sh` builds `build/crazygames/` and
  `build/pour-sort-crazygames.zip` with a relative `<base href="./">`, the SDK
  script before `flutter_bootstrap.js`, no `*.symbols`, at most 1500 files and
  50MB.

Out of scope: ads, gameplay changes, portal submission. (The Data/User modules were later added for progress saving only by `feature-crazygames-cloud-save`.)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` pass.
- A widget test with a recording fake platform shows the call order: start
  after launch (when the tutorial is already seen), stop while the overlay is
  open, start after it closes, stop on clear, start on the next level; first
  launch sends no start until the overlay closes; restart while playing sends
  no duplicate.
- Browser tests (`flutter test --platform chrome test/web`) cover: missing
  SDK, `disabled` environment, rejected and hung init, gameplay events.
- `tool/build_crazygames.sh` produces the zip and passes its self-checks.
- `flutter build web --release --base-href /PourSort/` output has no CrazyGames SDK
  script.

## Constraints
- Gameplay, levels and persistence do not change.
- Gameplay must work without the SDK or network.
- No new pub dependency (`dart:js_interop` only).

## Evidence
- flutter analyze
- flutter test
- flutter test --platform chrome test/web
- tool/build_crazygames.sh
- node <harness-lab>/dist/index.js audit . --format md
